To connect to any db or server on the host machine from any containers can be done 
using [host.docker.internal:PORT]
	
If we are running a DB server as container then we can use the IP address of that
container for the connection.(Not recommended)
Use --network for inter container communication and use the name of the container
for the connection


To create network
	docker network create [name]
